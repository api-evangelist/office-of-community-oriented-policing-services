  The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) is a
  component of the U.S. Department of Justice that works to advance the practice
  of community policing in law enforcement agencies across the country. The COPS
  Office provides grants, resources, and technical assistance to help law
  enforcement agencies develop and implement community policing strategies that
  build trust and collaboration with the communities they serve. By emphasizing
  problem-solving, partnerships, and community engagement, the COPS Office helps
  law enforcement agencies better address the root causes of crime and improve
  overall public safety. Additionally, the COPS Office conducts research and
  analysis to identify best practices in community policing and share this
  information with law enforcement agencies nationwide. Through their efforts,
  the COPS Office aims to promote transparency, accountability, and positive
  relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
